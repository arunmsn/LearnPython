THE print FUNCTION:
print("maroon",5) outputs "maroon 5" to the console but in reality outputting "maroon 5\n"
default print() outputs "\n" (a single newline character)
The default print() method [say, print("hello", "world")] is separated by spaces. To change this, there should be a final specification parameter.
    print("hello", "world")             # outputs "hello world"
    print("hello", "world", sep="-")    # outputs "hello-world"
    print("hello", "world", sep='')     # outputs "helloworld"
The default print() method [say, print("I love", "Python")] ends with a newline character. To change this, there should be a final specification parameter.
    print("I love", "Python")           # outputs "I love Python\n"
    print("I love", "Python", end='')   # outputs "I love Python"
Both these can be used to program the following:
    print("What is your name?", "Bob The Builder", sep=": ", end='! ')
    print("@BobTheBuilder", "#bobbuilds", "\"BobTheBuilder\"", sep="|", end='')
    # outputs --> What is your name? : Bob The Builder! @BobTheBuilder|#bobbuilds|"BobTheBuilder"

THE input FUNCTION:
year = int(input("In what year were you born?: "))          # this program takes in an input after displaying the string parameter (optional) and sets the value to year

A more complicated program:
reply = input("Enter x and y, separated by spaces: ")
pieces = reply.split()                                      # returns a list of strings, separated by spaces
x = float(pieces[0])
y = float(pieces[1])

A more useful program:
age = int(input("Enter your age in years: "))
max_heart_rate = 206.9 - (0.67 * age)                       # this program assumes age is a valid input, and calculation based on Med Scho Spots Exerc.
target = 0.65 * max_heart_rate
print("Your target fat-burning heart rate is ", target)     # outputs the target heart rate based on calculations

FILES:
Let's use the base command fp = open("sample.txt") [fp is short for file proxy, as the opened file is a proxy]
This command attempts to open a files named "sample.txt" and returns a proxy view that is read-only access to the file.
open() does accept second parameters to determine access mode, those being 
    r (reading)             # to read files, intial position at 0
    w (writing)             # this means any file named "sample.txt" (or whichever specified) will be overwritten, initial position at 0
    a (appending)           # appends to the end of any existing file, initial position at end of file
    rb (reading binary)     # works to read binary files
    wb (writing binary)     # works to write on binary files

CALLING SYNTAX              Description
fp.open(filename,access)    Opens the file with the specified filename and access mode.
fp.close()                  Closes the file.
fp.read()                   Return the remaining contents of a readable file as a string.
fp.read(k)                  Return the next k bytes of a readable file as a string.
fp.readline()               Return (remainder of) the current line of a readable file as a string.
fp.readlines()              Return all (remaining) lines of a readable file as a list of strings.
for line in fp:             Iterate all remaining lines of a readable file.
fp.seek(k)                  Change the current position to be at the kth byte of the file.
fp.tell()                   Return the current position, measured as byte-offset from the start.
fp.write(string)            Write given string at current position of the writable file.
fp.writelines(seq)          Write each of the strings of the given sequence at the current position of the writable file, writing no more than specified by the sequence.
print(...,file=fp)          Redirect output of print function to the file.
