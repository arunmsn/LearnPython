Use sequence data as a parameter to the function.
Inside the function:
    Create a new, empty sequence
    Using negative indices, place into the new sequence each integer
        The new sequence will now be the old in reverse order
    Set the old sequence to be the new sequence

In Python, there is a function called reversed(), which takes no parameter, and reverses the sequence.
